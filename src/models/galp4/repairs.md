## Replacing the CMOS battery:

The CMOS battery supplies power to the system's CMOS chip. UEFI settings and the computer's hardware clock are stored on the CMOS. If your system doesn't boot, you can reset the CMOS to force a low-level hardware reset. If your clock is constantly resetting, it's likely your CMOS battery needs to be replaced.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver    
**Time estimate:** 10 minutes    
**Difficulty:** Easy <span style="color:green;">●</span>

### Steps to replace the CMOS battery:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the keyboard](#replacing-the-keyboard) and [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Unplug the white connector attaching the CMOS battery to the motherboard (highlighted green below.)

![CMOS battery](./img/cmos-battery.jpg)

3. If you are replacing the CMOS battery, pull it away from the adhesive holding it to the case.
4. To clear the CMOS, [disconnect the main battery](#removing-the-battery), open the lid of the machine, and hold down the power button for at least 15 seconds to discharge any residual energy in the system.
5. Re-connect the CMOS battery and the main battery, and replace the bottom panel and keyboard.
7. Power up the machine. The system may power itself off and on after initial boot; this is normal behavior when the CMOS has been reset.

## Replacing the cooling system:

The Galago Pro 4 has a single fan and heatsink to cool the CPU. The fan and heatsink can be removed or replaced separately from one another.

If the fan becomes noisy and cleaning it out doesn't fix the issue, you may need a new fan. Contact Support to start a warranty claim or parts purchase.

Depending on your climate and the age of the machine, it may be necessary to apply new thermal paste between the CPU and the heatsink. Thermal paste helps facilitate effective heat transfer between the CPU and the cooling equipment. These instructions can also be used in the unlikely event your heatsink needs replacing.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver, thermal paste  
**Time estimate:** 20 minutes  
**Difficulty:** High <span style="color:red;">●</span>  

### Steps to replace the fan:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the keyboard](#replacing-the-keyboard) and [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Remove the two fan screws, highlighted green below.

![Thermal screws](./img/thermal-system.jpg)

3. Unplug the black fan connector, highlighted cyan above. Remove any clear tape that may be holding the wires in place.
4. Remove the fan from the system.

### Steps to replace the heatsink/thermal paste:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the keyboard](#replacing-the-keyboard) and [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Remove the three heatsink screws (highlighted red above) in order, starting with #1, then #2, and finally #3.
3. Remove the heatsink from the system, being careful not to bend the heatsink pipe. It may take some pressure to break the seal of the thermal paste.
4. Using a paper towel, remove the existing thermal paste. You may also use a small amount of rubbing alcohol if the old paste is dried or difficult to remove.

![Thermal paste removal](./img/thermal-paste-removal.jpg)

5. After cleaning the CPU and heatsink, apply a small line of thermal paste directly onto the CPU chip.

![Thermal paste application](./img/thermal-paste-application.jpg)

6. Carefully replace the heatsink.
7. Replace the three heatsink screws, starting with #1, then #2, and finally #3.
