5. Remove the card from the M.2 slot.
6. Insert the new wireless card into the M.2 slot at an angle.
7. Hold the card down and attach the two antennas by aligning the circular fittings and pressing onto the wireless card. The connectors will snap into place. _Use caution when attaching the connectors; the pins can bend, break, or snap._
8. Replace the metal bracket and the retaining screw.
9. Replace the M.2 SSD in slot 4 (if necessary) and bottom panel.

## Replacing the CMOS battery:

The CMOS battery supplies power to the system's CMOS chip. UEFI settings and the comptuer's hardware clock are stored on the CMOS. If your system doesn't boot, you can reset the CMOS to force a low-level hardware reset. If your clock is constantly resetting, it's likely your CMOS battery needs to be replaced.

**Warning (ingestion hazard):** Keep batteries out of reach of children. Death or serious injury can occur if ingested. If a battery is suspected to be swallowed or inserted inside any part of the body, seek immediate medical attention. In the US, you can also call the National Battery Ingestion Hotline for guidance: [+1 (800) 498-8666](tel:18004988666)

**Part numbers:**
- The CMOS battery is a standard 3V KTS CR2032W battery.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver    
**Time estimate:** 10 minutes    
**Difficulty:** Easy <span style="color:green;">●</span>

### Steps to replace the CMOS battery:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
    - If you're clearing the CMOS, also [unplug the main battery](#replacing-the-battery).
2. Unplug the white connector that connects the CMOS battery to the motherboard's `J_RTC1` port (near SSD slot 2).
    - If you're replacing the battery, gently pull it up from where it's stuck to the case.

![CMOS battery](./img/cmos-battery.webp)

3. To clear the CMOS, open the lid of the machine and hold down the power button for at least 15 seconds to discharge any residual energy in the system.
4. Re-connect the CMOS battery and the main battery.
5. Power up the Bonobo WS. The system may power itself off and on after initial boot; this is normal behavior when the CMOS has been reset.

2. Remove the four silver screws holding the subwoofer onto the heatsink.

![Subwoofer screws & connector](./img/speaker-subwoofer.webp)

3. Unplug the subwoofer from the `J_SPKL5` port on the motherboard and remove it from the chassis.
4. Replace the subwoofer and bottom cover.

### Steps to replace the left and right speakers:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
    - For the right speaker, also [remove the M.2 SSD from slot 4](#replacing-an-m2nvme-ssd) (if installed).
2. Pull the speaker(s) off of the plastic posts.

![Audio daughterboard](./img/speakers-left-right.webp)

3. Disconnect the speaker connector(s) from the motherboard.
    - The left speaker (pictured on the right above) connects to `J_SPK1`.
    - The right speaker (pictured on the left) connects to `J_SPK2`.
4. Replace the speaker(s) and bottom cover.

## Replacing the cooling system:

The Bonobo WS 16 has a single heatsink assembly with two fans. This assembly cools the CPU and GPU.

If the fans become noisy and cleaning them out doesn't fix the issue, you may need a new fan. [Contact support](https://support.system76.com) to start a warranty claim or parts purchase.

Depending on your climate and the age of the machine, it may be necessary to apply new thermal paste between the CPU/GPU and the heatsink. Thermal paste helps facilitate effective heat transfer between the CPU/GPU and the cooling equipment. These instructions can also be used in the unlikely event your heatsink needs to be replaced.

**Part numbers:**
- Heatsink/fan assembly: `6-31-X580N-101`
- Individual fans (may not be available separately):
    - Left fan: Yingfan `NA901212HHT4B10001 DX1`
    - Right fan: Yingfan `NB901212HHT4B0001 DX2`

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver  
**Time estimate:** 15 minutes  
**Difficulty:** High <span style="color:red;">●</span>  

### Steps to replace the heatsink/thermal paste:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover) and [remove the SSD from slot 1](#replacing-an-m2nvme-ssd) (if installed).
2. [Disconnect the subwoofer](#steps-to-replace-the-subwoofer) from the motherboard's `J_SPKL5` header.
    - You can optionally remove the subwoofer. In the photo below, the subwoofer has been removed to better illustrate the location of the heatsink screws.
3. Remove the fourteen heatsink and fan screws in order of the stamped numbers, starting with #1, then #2, and continuing until you have removed #14.
    - Screws #1-#12 are held captive, and will not completely detatch from the heatsink/fans.
    - Screws #13 and #14 are slightly smaller than the rest of the screws, and are not held captive.
    - Do not remove the smaller screws holding the fan covers onto the fans.

![Thermal screws](./img/thermal-system.webp)

4. Remove any clear tape covering the fan wires.
5. Unplug the black fan connectors from the motherboard's fan headers, `J_VGAFAN1` (highlighted red above) and `J_CPUFAN1` (highlighted green).
6. Remove the heatsink/fans from the case, being careful not to bend the heatsink pipes. It may take some pressure to break the seal of the thermal paste.
7. Using a paper towel, remove the existing thermal paste from the CPU, GPU, VRAM chips, and heatsink. You may also use a small amount of rubbing alcohol if the old paste is dried or difficult to remove.
    - In the below photos, the subwoofer is screwed into the heatsink, so its cable is visible in addition to the fan cables.

![Thermal paste removal](./img/thermal-paste-removal.webp)

8. Apply a small line of thermal paste directly onto the CPU chip, the GPU chip, and the eight VRAM chips.

![Thermal paste application](./img/thermal-paste-application.webp)

9. Carefully replace the heatsink.
    - Make sure the tab on the end of the keyboard adhesive strip (highlighted green above) is fed through the slot in the heatsink (next to the GPU fan).
10. Tighten the fan and heatsink screws from #1 to #12, then reinstall the final two heatsink screws (#13 and #14).
11. Plug the black fan connectors back into the motherboard and (optionally) replace the clear tape holding down the CPU fan's cable.

## Replacing the keyboard:

The keyboard includes per-key RGB LED backlighting, and can be replaced using the instructions below.

**Warning:** Removing the keyboard may cause permanent aesthetic damage to the underside of the keyboard, particularly if the adhesive strip is not fully removed first. Removal is not recommended unless the keyboard is malfunctioning.

**Part numbers:**

**Time estimate:** 10 minutes  
**Difficulty:** High <span style="color:red;">●</span>  

### Steps to replace the keyboard:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Pull the keyboard adhesive out of the machine to detatch it from the keyboard.
    - The adhesive strip access point is highlighted green below.
    - If the end of the keyboard adhesive strip is tucked behind the fan, it can be pulled out using tweezers or a small screwdriver, or the [thermal system can be removed](#replacing-the-cooling-system) to expose it.
        - Replacing the thermal paste is recommended if the thermal system is removed.
    - If the adhesive strip breaks, remove as much of it as possible. The keyboard can be reinstalled without the adhesive strip.
