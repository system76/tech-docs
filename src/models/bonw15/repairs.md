![Wireless card](./img/wireless-card.webp)

3. Gently remove the two antennas (highlighted red above) by pulling them up and away from the wireless card.
4. Remove the retaining screw opposite the M.2 slot, highlighted yellow above.
5. The wireless card will pop up at an angle. Remove the card from the M.2 slot.
6. Insert the new wireless card into the M.2 slot at an angle.
7. Hold the card down and replace the retaining screw.
8. Attach the two antennas by aligning the circular fittings and pressing onto the wireless card. The connectors will snap into place. _Use caution when attaching the connectors; the pins can bend, break, or snap._

## Replacing the CMOS battery:

The CMOS battery supplies power to the system's CMOS chip. UEFI settings and the comptuer's hardware clock are stored on the CMOS. If your system doesn't boot, you can reset the CMOS to force a low-level hardware reset. If your clock is constantly resetting, it's likely your CMOS battery needs to be replaced.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver    
**Time estimate:** 10 minutes    
**Difficulty:** Easy <span style="color:green;">●</span>

### Steps to replace the CMOS battery:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Unplug the white connector that connects the CMOS battery to the motherboard.
    - If you are replacing the battery, gently pull from the sides to pry it up from where it's stuck to the case.

![CMOS battery](./img/cmos-battery.webp)

3. To clear the CMOS, open the lid of the machine and hold down the power button for at least 15 seconds to discharge any residual energy in the system.
4. Re-connect the CMOS battery and the main battery.
5. Replace the SSDs and wireless card (if necessary) and the bottom panel.
6. Power up the Bonobo WS. The system may power itself off and on after initial boot; this is normal behavior when the CMOS has been reset.

## Replacing the cooling system:

The Bonobo WS 13 has a single heatsink assembly with two fans. This assembly cools the CPU and GPU.

If the fans become noisy and cleaning them out doesn't fix the issue, you may need a new fan. [Contact support](https://support.system76.com) to start a warranty claim or parts purchase.

Depending on your climate and the age of the machine, it may be necessary to apply new thermal paste between the CPU/GPU and the heatsink. Thermal paste helps facilitate effective heat transfer between the CPU/GPU and the cooling equipment. These instructions can also be used in the unlikely event your heatsink needs to be replaced.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver  
**Time estimate:** 15 minutes  
**Difficulty:** High <span style="color:red;">●</span>  

### Steps to replace the heatsink/thermal paste:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover) and [remove any SSDs present in slots 2 and 3](#replacing-an-m2nvme-ssd).
2. Remove the thirteen heatsink and fan screws in order of the stamped numbers, starting with #1, then #2, and continuing until you have removed #13.
    - Screws #1-#12 are held captive, and will not completely detatch from the heatsink/fans. Screw #13 is not held captive, and will come loose when untightened.
    - Do not remove the smaller screws holding the fan covers onto the fans.

![Thermal screws](./img/thermal-screws.webp)

3. Remove any clear tape covering the fan wires.
    - The tape covering the [wireless card antennas](#replacing-the-wireless-card) may also need to be removed.
4. Unplug the black fan connectors from the motherboard.
5. Remove the heatsink/fans from the case, being careful not to bend the heatsink pipes. It may take some pressure to break the seal of the thermal paste.
6. Using a paper towel, remove the existing thermal paste from the CPU, GPU, VRAM chips, and heatsink. You may also use a small amount of rubbing alcohol if the old paste is dried or difficult to remove.

![Thermal paste removal](./img/thermal-paste-removal.webp)

7. Apply a small line of thermal paste directly onto the CPU chip, GPU chip, and VRAM chips.

![Thermal paste application](./img/thermal-paste-application.webp)

8. Carefully replace the heatsink.
9. Replace the fan and heatsink screws, starting with #1, then #2, and so on until #13.
10. Plug the black fan connectors back into the motherboard and (optionally) replace the clear tape.

## Replacing the speakers:

The system has two bottom-firing speakers, which can be removed and replaced individually.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver    
**Time estimate:** 10 minutes    
**Difficulty:** Medium <span style="color:orange;">●</span>

### Steps to replace the left speaker:

## Replacing the keyboard:

The keyboard includes per-key RGB LED backlighting, and can be replaced using the instructions below.

**Warning:** Removing the keyboard may cause permanent aesthetic damage to the underside of the keyboard, particularly if the adhesive strip is not fully removed first. Removal is not recommended unless the keyboard is malfunctioning.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver; tweezers (optional)  
**Time estimate:** 10 minutes  
**Difficulty:** High <span style="color:red;">●</span>  

### Steps to replace the keyboard:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Pull the keyboard adhesive out of the machine to detatch it from the keyboard.
    - The adhesive strip access point is highlighted green below.
    - If the end of the keyboard adhesive strip is tucked behind the fan, it can be pulled out using tweezers or a small screwdriver, or the [thermal system can be removed](#replacing-the-cooling-system) to expose it.
        - Replacing the thermal paste is recommended if the thermal system is removed.
    - If the adhesive strip breaks, remove as much of it as possible. The keyboard can be reinstalled without the adhesive strip.

![Keyboard adhesive & push point](./img/keyboard-adhesive.webp)
