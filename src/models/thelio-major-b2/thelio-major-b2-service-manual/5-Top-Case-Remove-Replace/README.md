Removing the lid will give you easy access to all components inside.
To remove the lid, you’ll need to unscrew the 4 thumbscrews from the back of the Thelio.
These thumbscrews will be on the top left and right, and bottom left and right of the back of the case.

Do not unscrew any screws in the center of the panel here, as those screws correspond with parts inside; removing them will not assist you in removing the lid.
All of Thelio’s thumbscrews are the same size, so don’t worry about mixing them up.
And while a screwdriver is recommended for this procedure, it is not required.
Once you have removed all 4 thumb-screws from the back of the lid, lift the lid up and off of the chassis.
Now you can proceed with servicing your machine.

This guide explains how to easily replace the Thelio’s Top Case after performing maintenance.

1. Align the grooves inside the case with the front of the Thelio frame (the side where the power-button is located).
2. Once aligned, the case should easily slide down over the chassis.
3. Press down on the Top Case to make sure it is firmly seated, and the power button is connected internally.
4. To ensure the case is seated correctly, plug the Thelio back into power, turn on the power-supply switch and examine the front of the unit: the power button LED should light up if you press it, and the system fans should spin to life.
