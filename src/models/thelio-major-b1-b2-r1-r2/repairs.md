# Top Case (Remove or replace)

## Removing the Top Case
Before servicing your Thelio, be sure to power off and unplug all cords from the computer.

You can find video instructions on this process [here.](https://youtu.be/Ku91wRHFGY8)

**Tools required:** Fingers or Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver

**Time estimate:** 2 minutes

**Difficulty:** <span style="color:green">Easy</span>

**Screws:** 8 total
  - 8 Thumbscrews (Phillips/Cross-head).

**Note:** These thumbscrews will be on the top left and right, middle left and right, and bottom left and right of the back of the case.

Do not unscrew any screws in the center of the panel. Those screws correspond with parts inside; removing them will not assist you in removing the lid.

All of Thelio’s thumbscrews are the same size, and are interchangeable.

PHOTOS NEED ADDED WITH SCREWS HIGHLIGHTED

**Fig. 9:** Thelio Outer Case views, front (left), back (middle), Top Case partial removal (right).-->

<!--locations of photos and/or description may change.-->

1. Unscrew the eight (8) thumbscrews from the back of the Thelio.
2. Lift the lid up and off of the chassis.

## Replacing the Top Case
This guide explains how to replace the Thelio’s Top Case after performing maintenance.

**Tools required**: Fingers or Crosshead (Phillips) screwdriver

**Time estimate**: 2 minutes

**Difficulty:** <span style="color:green">Easy</span>

**Screws:** 8 total
 - 8 Thumbscrews (Phillips/Crosshead).

1. Align the grooves inside the case with the front of the Thelio frame (the side where the power-button is located).
2. Once aligned, the case should easily slide down over the chassis.
3. Press down on the Top Case to make sure it is firmly seated, and the power button is connected internally. There should be no space between the bottom of the Top Case and the Thelio frame.
4. To ensure the case is seated correctly, plug the Thelio back into power, turn on the power-supply switch, and examine the front of the unit: the power button LED should light up if you press it, and the system fans should spin to life.

# Power Button (Remove or Replace)
If you’ve purchased a new top case for your Thelio (or received one for a support case), you may need to move the power button from your old top case to the new one. Conversely, if you’ve received a replacement power button, you may need to remove the old power button from your top case and install the new one.

## Removing the Power Button
The power button assembly is held on by a single nut inside the case.

**Tools required:** Needle-nose pliers.

**Time estimate:** 5 minutes

**Difficulty:** <span style="color:green">Easy</span>

1. Follow the steps to [remove the top case](#removing-the-top-case)
2. Unplug the power button’s wire from the 90-degree connector (Fig. 12).
3. Next, unscrew the nut from the power button. Use a pair of needle-nose pliers to loosen the nut (Fig. 14).
4. Once the nut has been loosened, use your fingers to remove it the rest of the way (Fig. 15).
5. With the wire unplugged and the nut removed, the power button can be pushed out the front of the case (Fig. 17).
6. The black plastic rectangle inside of the case will also be loose at this point, and can be removed.

## Replacing the Power Button

**Tools required:** Needle-nose pliers.

**Time estimate:** 5 minutes

**Difficulty:** <span style="color:green">Easy</span>

1. Line up the black plastic rectangle with the hole inside of the case (Fig. 20).
2. While holding the black plastic rectangle to the hole, feed the power button wire through the hole and push the power button into the case (Fig. 21).
3. While holding the button in from the front, thread the power button wire through the nut, then screw the nut onto the power button (Fig. 24).
4. Tighten the nut with a pair of needle-nose pliers to ensure the plastic bracket doesn’t move around later (Fig. 26).
5. Finally, plug the power button’s wire into the 90-degree connector so the red wire is on the left (Fig. 27).
6. Follow the steps to [replace the top case](#replacing-the-top-case)
