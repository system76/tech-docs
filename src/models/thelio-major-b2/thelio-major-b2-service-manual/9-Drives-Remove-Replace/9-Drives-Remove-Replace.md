# Drives (Remove or Replace)

## 2.5" SATA Drives

The thelio B1 provides four (4) slots for 2.5” SATA drives. They are housed in the Thelio Drive Cage for easy access. Each drive is connected to a SATA port on the Thelio IO board, which acts as a conduit, connecting the drives to the motherboard.


## M.2 Drives

The Thelio B1 has two M.2 drive slots. One on the inside of the board, above the PCIe slot which holds the GPU, and one on the back of the unit on the outside of the board (pictured above).

The internal M.2 storage drive is situated somewhat behind the GPU in the chassis. If you install an M.2 drive in this slot, you may need to remove the GPU beforehand to free up space. You can find video instructions on this process here. If your Thelio has only one M.2 drive, or do not have a GPU installed. You can simply unscrew the M.2 drive from the chassis, without needing to remove a GPU.
