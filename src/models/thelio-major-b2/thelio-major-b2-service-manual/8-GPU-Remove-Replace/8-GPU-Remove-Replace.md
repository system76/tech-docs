# GPU (Remove or replace)

## Removing the GPU

GPU Removal is a multistep process, but it is not complicated. A cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver may be helpful, as well as a wooden or plastic (non-conductive) tool for reaching between components. A pencil, ruler, chopsticks or a plastic computer repair tool will work well. **Do not use anything made of metal.**

**Tools required:** Fingers or Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver, a tool for pressing the GPU release bracket (non-conductive).
**Time estimate:** 10 minutes.
**Difficulty:** ***Medium***
**Screws:** 16 total
  - 16 Thumbscrews (Phillips/Crosshead).

In this guide, you will learn how to remove the graphics card on your Thelio. These steps must be taken in order to replace the GPU.

**Before you remove the lid, be sure to power off and unplug all cords from the computer.**

1. First follow the steps in Removing the Top Case.
2. It may also be helpful to Remove the CPU Cooler Shroud.
3. To remove your graphics card, twist off the 4 thumbscrews from the PCI bracket.
4. Remove the GPU brace. Unscrew the bottom two screws, and then the top two screws, to remove the brace. Both the PCI bracket and the GPU brace keep your graphics card secure and in place (Fig 23).
5. Remove the GPU from the PCIe slot by pressing on the release clip on the right. This is where your chosen (non-metal) poking tool may come in handy, to reach the clip on the board without trying to squeeze your hand between components.
6. Disconnect the power cables from the GPU (if applicable), and tie back any cables you aren’t planning on using with the provided velcro straps.
7. Now you are ready to install an alternative or replacement GPU.
8. If you are not planning on installing another GPU follow the steps to Replace the CPU Cooler Shroud, Replace the Top Case, and reconnect all cables and peripherals.

1. After removing the GPU (Or, if no GPU is installed, removing the bracket, insert the new graphics card into the PCIe lane slot until it clicks into place.
2. Once the GPU is securely in place, attach the internal and external brackets.
3. Securely fasten the brackets in place with the provided thumbscrews.
4. Prepare the necessary power connectors for your graphics card. You can tell which wires you’ll need by looking at the ports on the front of your GPU. The necessary cabling is provided inside your Thelio’s chassis.
5. Do not connect the cables to the GPU until it has been inserted in the PCIe slot and secured with the brackets.
6. Connect the power cables to the GPU selecting the cables based on the number of pins (See NOTE below).
7. Wrap up any unused wires with the velcro strap and store those wires back in the chassis so that they’re not blocking the fan.

**NOTE: Some GPU's use the PCI-e slot for power and don't need a cable. If your Thelio is configured with a Radeon RX 550 graphics card, for example, you will not find any power connectors in your GPU. The cards compatible with this Thelio model require 8-pin, 12 pin or 16-pin power cable connections.**

8. Once the GPU is connected and the power cables secured, replace the Top Case, reconnect external power cable.
9. Turn the power supply switch at the rear of the machine to the “on” position.
