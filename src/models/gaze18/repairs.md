4. Insert the new M.2 drive into the slot and hold it in place.
5. Replace the retainer screw.

## Replacing the wireless card:

Your Gazelle's WiFi and Bluetooth are both handled by the same module. It is a standard M.2 2230 slot with PCIe and USB interfaces (A Key).

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver  
**Time estimate:** 15 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Medium <span style="color:orange;">●</span>  

### Steps to replace the WiFi/Bluetooth module:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Locate the wireless module. Remove any clear tape that is securing the wires.

![Wireless card](./img/wireless-card.webp)

3. Gently remove the two antennas (highlighted red above) by pulling them up and away from the wireless card.
4. Remove the retaining screw opposite the M.2 slot, highlighted yellow above.
5. The wireless card will pop up at an angle. Remove the card from the M.2 slot.
6. Insert the new wireless card into the M.2 slot at an angle.
7. Replace the retaining screw.
8. Attach the two antennas by aligning the circular fittings and pressing onto the wireless card. The connectors will snap into place. _Use caution when attaching the connectors; the pins can bend, break, or snap._

## Replacing the battery:

The battery provides primary power whenever the system is unplugged.

**Tools required:** None  
**Time estimate:** 1 minute  
**Difficulty:** Easy <span style="color:green;">●</span>

### Steps to replace the battery:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Remove the five battery screws, highlighted yellow below.

![Battery](./img/battery.webp)

3. Unplug the battery connector (highlighted red above) and lift the battery out of the chassis.

## Replacing the CMOS battery:

The CMOS battery supplies power to the system's CMOS chip. UEFI settings and the computer's hardware clock are stored on the CMOS. If your system doesn't boot, you can reset the CMOS to force a low-level hardware reset. If your clock is constantly resetting, it's likely your CMOS battery needs to be replaced.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver    
**Time estimate:** 15 minutes    
**Difficulty:** Medium <span style="color:orange;">●</span>

### Steps to replace the CMOS battery:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Follow the steps above to [remove the outermost M.2 drive](#replacing-an-m2nvme-ssd), then pull the battery away from the adhesive holding it to the case. 
    - If you are not replacing the CMOS battery, this step is optional, but will make it easier to unplug the CMOS battery connector.
3. Unplug the white connector that connects the CMOS battery to the motherboard.

![CMOS battery](./img/cmos-battery.webp)

4. To clear the CMOS, [disconnect the main battery](#replacing-the-battery), open the lid of the machine, and hold down the power button for at least 15 seconds to discharge any residual energy in the system.
5. Re-connect the CMOS battery.
6. [Reconnect the main battery](#replacing-the-battery), [replace the M.2 SSD](#replacing-an-m2nvme-ssd), and [replace the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
7. Power up the Gazelle. The system may power itself off and on after initial boot; this is normal behavior when the CMOS has been reset.

## Replacing the cooling system:

The Gazelle 18 includes two fans as part of a single heatsink/fan assembly.

If the CPU/GPU fans become noisy and cleaning them out doesn't fix the issue, you may need a new fan. [Contact support](https://support.system76.com) to start a warranty claim or parts purchase.

Thermal paste helps facilitate heat transfer between the CPU/GPU and the cooling equipment. Depending on your climate and the age of the machine, replacing the thermal paste between the CPU/GPU and the heatsink may help the system run cooler.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver  
**Time estimate:** 20 minutes  
**Difficulty:** High <span style="color:red;">●</span>  

### Steps to replace the fans/heatsink/thermal paste:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Remove any clear tape that is securing the fan wires.
3. Remove the silver heatsink and fan screws in the order of the stamped numbers, starting with #1, then #2, and continuing until you have removed #12.
    - *Note: Do not remove the smaller black screws holding the fan covers onto the fans.*

![Thermal screws](./img/thermal-screws.webp)

4. Unplug the two white fan connectors from the motherboard (highlighted cyan above).
5. Remove the heatsink/fans from the case, being careful not to bend the heatsink pipes. It may take some pressure to break the seal of the thermal paste.
6. Using a paper towel, remove the existing thermal paste. You may also use a small amount of rubbing alcohol if the old paste is dried or difficult to remove.

![Thermal paste removal](./img/thermal-paste-removal.webp)

7. After cleaning the CPU, GPU, and heatsink, apply a small line of thermal paste directly onto both CPU chips and the GPU chip.

![Thermal paste application](./img/thermal-paste-application.webp)

8. Carefully replace the heatsink.
9. Replace the silver heatsink and fan screws, starting with #1, then #2, and so on until #12.
10. Plug the two white fan connectors back into the motherboard.

## Replacing the keyboard:

The keyboard can be replaced if its switches or electronics have been damaged.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver, tweezers (optional)  
**Time estimate:** 10 minutes  
**Difficulty:** High <span style="color:red;">●</span>

### Steps to replace the keyboard:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Locate the keyboard adhesive strip at the edge of the motherboard underneath the right fan's heatsink pipe, highlighted green below.
    - You can optionally [remove the heatsink](#replacing-the-cooling-system) to make the adhesive easier to grasp. Replacing the thermal paste is recommended if the heatsink is removed.

![Keyboard adhesive strip location](./img/keyboard-adhesive.webp)

3. Using a pair of tweezers to reach the end of the strip (if necessary), pull out the end of the keyboard adhesive strip to stretch and detatch it.
4. Open the lid slightly and place the machine on its side.
5. Push a screwdriver into the keyboard push point (next to the RAM slot) until the keyboard pops out.
