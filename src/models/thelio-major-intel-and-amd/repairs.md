# Top Case (Remove or replace)

## Removing the Top Case
Before servicing your Thelio, be sure to power off and unplug all cords from the computer.

You can find video instructions on this process [here.](https://youtu.be/Ku91wRHFGY8)

Link for the video for Top Case Service:
(https://youtu.be/Ku91wRHFGY8)

Tools required: Fingers or Crosshead (Phillips) screwdriver

Time estimate: 2 minutes

Difficulty: <span style="color:green">Easy</span>

Screws: 8 total
  - 8 Thumbscrews (Phillips/Crosshead).

<!--[Thelio Outer Case views](../../pictures/thelio/thelio-b1/)

**Fig. 9:** Thelio Outer Case views, front (left), back (middle), Top Case partial removal (right).-->

<!--locations of photos and/or description may change.-->

Removing the lid will give you access to all components inside.
To remove the lid, unscrew the eight (8) thumbscrews from the back of the Thelio.
These thumbscrews will be on the top left and right, middle left and right, and bottom left and right of the back of the case.

Do not unscrew any screws in the center of the panel. Those screws correspond with parts inside; removing them will not assist you in removing the lid.
All of Thelio’s thumbscrews are the same size, and are interchangeable.
While a screwdriver is recommended for this procedure, it is not required.
Once you have removed all eight (8) thumb-screws from the back of the lid, lift the lid up and off of the chassis.
Now you can proceed with servicing your machine.
<!--WARNING this is actually an R1-->

## Replacing the Top Case
This guide explains how to replace the Thelio’s Top Case after performing maintenance.

**Tools required**: Fingers or Crosshead (Phillips) screwdriver

**Time estimate**: 2 minutes

**Difficulty:** <span style="color:green">Easy</span>

**Screws:** 8 total
 - 8 Thumbscrews (Phillips/Crosshead).

1. Align the grooves inside the case with the front of the Thelio frame (the side where the power-button is located).
2. Once aligned, the case should easily slide down over the chassis.
3. Press down on the Top Case to make sure it is firmly seated, and the power button is connected internally. There should be no space between the bottom of the Top Case and the Thelio frame.
4. To ensure the case is seated correctly, plug the Thelio back into power, turn on the power-supply switch and examine the front of the unit: the power button LED should light up if you press it, and the system fans should spin to life.

1. After [removing the GPU](#removing-the-gpu) (Or, if no GPU is installed, removing the bracket, insert the new graphics card into the PCIe slot until it clicks into place.
2. Once the GPU is securely in place, attach the internal and external brackets.
3. Securely fasten the brackets in place with the provided thumbscrews.
4. Prepare the necessary power connectors for your graphics card. You can tell which wires you’ll need by looking at the ports on the front of your GPU. The necessary cabling is provided inside your Thelio’s chassis.
5. Do not connect the cables to the GPU until it has been inserted in the PCIe slot and secured with the brackets.
6. Connect the power cables to the GPU selecting the cables based on the number of pins (See NOTE below).
7. Wrap up any unused wires with the velcro strap and store those wires back in the chassis so that they’re not blocking the fan.

**NOTE: Some GPU's use the PCI-e slot for power and don't need a cable. If your Thelio is configured with a Radeon RX 550 graphics card, for example, you will not find any power connector slots on your GPU. The cards compatible with this Thelio model require 8-pin, 12 pin or 16-pin power cable connections.**

# CPU Thermal Paste (Remove or Replace)

If you are experiencing thermal issues with your Thelio, one possible solution is to change the Thermal paste. Thermal paste helps transfer heat from the CPU to the CPU Cooler via the heat sink.

Thermal paste can lose its effectiveness over time and may need to be removed and replaced.

This guide will explain how to remove the CPU Cooler, clean the CPU of thermal paste, and reapply a new coat.


## Remove the CPU Thermal Paste

Removing CPU thermal paste requires removal of the CPU Cooler Shroud. It may also require removing the GPU for easier access.

**Tools required:** Crosshead (Phillips) screwdriver, Rubbing Alcohol, Paper Towels, Thermal Paste.

**Time estimate:** 15-20 mins.

**Difficulty:** <span style="color:red">Hard</span>

**Screws:** 16 total
  - 8 Thumbscrews (Phillips/Crosshead) on the Top Case.
  - 4 Thumbscrews (Phillips/Crosshead) on the CPU Cooler Shroud.
  - 4 Bracket Screws securing the CPU heat sink.

<!-- all of these screw numbers will need verified-->

1. Follow the steps in [Removing the Top Case.](#removing-the-top-case)
2. Follow the steps in [Removing the CPU Cooler Shroud.](#removing-the-shroud)
3. Follow the steps in [Removing the GPU](#removing-the-gpu) (if applicable).
4. Gently but firmly separate the Cooling Fans from the Heat Sink (fig. 33). The fans are held on by clips which can be pried from the sides of the heat sink.
5. Next, disconnect the power cables from the Cooling Fans.
6. Remove the four (4) bracket screws fastening the Heat Sink to the board. Loosen the screws one at a time. Move from opposite corner to opposite corner, diagonally across the Heat Sink. For example: first, top left screw, then bottom right screw (fig. 34). This ensures even pressure between the brackets and the motherboard.
7. Lift the Heat Sink off of the motherboard.
8. You’ll notice that there is Thermal Paste coating the bottom of the Heat Sink as well as the CPU core.
9. Apply Rubbing Alcohol to a sheet of Paper Towel and wipe the Thermal Paste off of the bottom of the Heat Sink and CPU core until they are totally clean.
10. If you are replacing the Thermal Paste, continue on to the section Replacing the CPU Thermal Paste (See Important NOTE below).
11. Replace the Heat Sink over the CPU core.
12. Re-fasten the Heat Sink screws, again using the opposite corner method described above.
13. Follow the steps to [Replace the GPU](#replacing-the-gpu) (if applicable).
14. Follow the steps to [Replace the CPU Cooler Shroud.](#replacing-the-shroud)
15. Follow the steps to [Replace the Top Case.](#replacing-the-top-case)

**NOTE: DO NOT use your Thelio without thermal paste.** Steps 11-12 above are there to help you reassemble your machine if you are not yet ready to apply new Thermal Paste. Running the machine without Thermal Paste could result in overheating, system shutdowns and possibly damage to the internal components.

## Replace the CPU Thermal paste

Replacing CPU thermal requires removal of the CPU Cooler Shroud. It may also require removing the GPU for easier access.

**Tools required:** Crosshead (Phillips) screwdriver, Thermal Paste.

**Time estimate:** 15-20 mins.

**Difficulty:** <span style="color:green">Easy</span>

**Screws:** 12 total
  - 8 Thumbscrews (Phillips/Crosshead) on the Top Case.
  - 4 Thumbscrews (Phillips/Crosshead) on the CPU Cooler Shroud.
  - 4 Bracket Screws securing the CPU heat sink.


1. Follow steps 1-9 in [Removing the CPU Thermal Paste.](#removing-cpu-thermal-paste)
2. Once the Heat Sink and CPU core are free of old Thermal Paste, apply new paste in a line down the middle of the CPU core (fig. 37).
3. Once the paste is applied, replace the Heat Sink over top of it. The Heat Sink will spread the thermal paste across the CPU core, there is no need to spread it yourself.
4. Re-fasten the four (4) screws on the Heat Sink. In fastening the screws, partially tighten them one at a time, and move diagonally to the opposite corner. For example, tighten the top-left screw halfway, then move to the bottom right, and tighten that halfway. Repeat until all screws are tight. This ensures even pressure between the brackets and the motherboard.
5. Once the Heat Sink is fastened down, clip the CPU Cooling Fans back onto the Heat Sink.
6. Reconnect the power cables to the CPU Cooling Fans.
7. Follow the steps in [Replacing the GPU](#replacing-the-gpu) (if applicable).
8. Next, follow the steps in [Replacing the CPU Cooler Shroud.](#replacing-the-shroud)
9. Follow the steps in [Replacing the Top Case.](#replacing-the-top-case)
10. Reconnect all external cables and peripherals, and turn the Power Supply switch to the “on” position.
11. Power on the Thelio to ensure successful boot.

**NOTE: The pictures shown here are the Thelio R1 (AMD) model with a Threadripper processor. However, the process and cautions when removing and replacing thermal paste are the same for both Intel and AMD Thelio Majors.**
