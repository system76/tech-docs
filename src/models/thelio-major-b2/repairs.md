(https://youtu.be/Ku91wRHFGY8)

Tools required: Fingers or Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver

Time estimate: 2 minutes

Difficulty: <span style="color:green">Easy</span>

Screws: 8 total
  - 8 Thumbscrews (Phillips/Crosshead).

![Thelio Outer Case views](../../pictures/thelio/thelio-b1/)

**Fig. 9:** Thelio Outer Case views, front (left), back (middle), Top Case partial removal (right).

<!--locations of photos and/or description may change.-->

Removing the lid will give you easy access to all components inside.
To remove the lid, you’ll need to unscrew the eight (8) thumbscrews from the back of the Thelio.
These thumbscrews will be on the top left and right, middle left and right, and bottom left and right of the back of the case.

Do not unscrew any screws in the center of the panel here, as those screws correspond with parts inside; removing them will not assist you in removing the lid.
All of Thelio’s thumbscrews are the same size, so don’t worry about mixing them up.
And while a screwdriver is recommended for this procedure, it is not required.
Once you have removed all eight (8) thumb-screws from the back of the lid, lift the lid up and off of the chassis.
Now you can proceed with servicing your machine.

## 2.5" SATA Drives

The Thelio Major B2 provides eight (8) slots for 2.5” SATA drives. They are housed in the Thelio Drive Cage for easy access. Each drive is connected to a SATA port on the Thelio IO board, which acts as a conduit, connecting the drives to the motherboard.


## M.2 Drives

The Thelio Major B1 has three (3) M.2 drive slots. One on the board, above the PCIe slot which holds the GPU, one below the right-side RAM slots, and one to the right of the lower 3 PCIe slots (pictured above).

One internal M.2 storage drive is situated somewhat behind the top GPU in the chassis. If you install an M.2 drive in this slot, you may need to remove the GPU beforehand to free up space. You can find video instructions on this process [here.](https://youtu.be/3bUcp0S1HrE) Another M.2 drive is situated beneath the right RAM slots, and so you will likely need to remove the CPU Cooler Shroud to gain easier access. If your Thelio has only one M.2 drive, or do not have a GPU installed. You can simply unscrew the M.2 drive from the chassis, without needing to remove a GPU.
