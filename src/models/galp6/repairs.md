6. Insert the new wireless card into the M.2 slot at an angle.
7. Replace the retaining screw.
8. Attach the two antennas by aligning the circular fittings and pressing onto the wireless card. The connectors will snap into place. _Use caution when attaching the connectors; the pins can bend, break, or snap._

## Replacing the CMOS battery:

The CMOS battery supplies power to the system's CMOS chip. UEFI settings and the computer's hardware clock are stored on the CMOS. If your system doesn't boot, you can reset the CMOS to force a low-level hardware reset. If your clock is constantly resetting, it's likely your CMOS battery needs to be replaced.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver    
**Time estimate:** 15 minutes    
**Difficulty:** Medium <span style="color:orange;">●</span>

### Steps to replace the CMOS battery:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Follow the steps above to [remove the M.2 drive](#replacing-an-m2nvme-ssd), then pull the battery away from the adhesive holding it to the case.
    - If you are not replacing the CMOS battery, this step is optional, but will make it easier to unplug the CMOS battery connector.

![CMOS battery](./img/cmos-battery.webp)

3. Unplug the white connector attaching the CMOS battery to the motherboard (highlighted green above.) 
4. To clear the CMOS, [disconnect the main battery](#removing-the-battery), open the lid of the machine, and hold down the power button for at least 15 seconds to discharge any residual energy in the system.
5. Re-connect the CMOS battery and main battery, and replace the M.2 drive and bottom panel.
6. Power up the machine. The system may power itself off and on after initial boot; this is normal behavior when the CMOS has been reset.

## Replacing the speakers:

The system has two bottom-firing speakers, which can be removed and replaced individually.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver  
**Time estimate:** 15 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy <span style="color:green;">●</span>

### Steps to replace the speakers:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover). For the right speaker, also [remove the battery](#removing-the-battery) and [remove the SSD](#replacing-an-m2nvme-ssd).
2. Unscrew the speaker screws.
    - Each speaker has two screws, which are set inside of rubber rings to reduce vibration.

![Speaker screws and connectors](./img/speakers.webp)

3. Disconnect the speaker wire from the motherboard and lift the speaker out of the machine.
    - The speaker wire may be partially routed behind other components or tape; be careful when removing it.
4. Place the new speaker in the machine, plug in the connector, replace the screws, and reinstall the SSD and battery (if necessary) and bottom panel.

## Replacing the cooling system:

The Galago Pro 6 has a single heatsink with two fans for the CPU and integrated GPU. Both fans are separate from the heatsink and can be replaced independently.

If a fan becomes noisy and cleaning it out doesn't fix the issue, you may need a new fan. [Contact support](https://support.system76.com) to start a warranty claim or parts purchase.

Depending on your climate and the age of the machine, it may be necessary to apply new thermal paste between the CPU and the heatsink. Thermal paste helps facilitate effective heat transfer between the CPU and the cooling equipment. These instructions can also be used in the unlikely event that your heatsink needs to be replaced.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver, thermal paste  
**Time estimate:** 20 minutes  
**Difficulty:** High <span style="color:red;">●</span>  

### Steps to replace the fans:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Remove any clear tape that is securing the fan wires.
3. Unplug the white fan connector (highlighted  below) for each fan you are removing from the system.

![Fan screws](./img/fan-screws.webp)

4. Remove the two fan screws (highlighted green above) for each fan you are removing.
5. Replace the fans, screw in the two fan screws for each fan, and plug the white fan connectors into the system.

### Steps to replace the heatsink/thermal paste:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover) and [remove the fan closest to the CPU](#steps-to-replace-the-fans).
    - Removing the fan is optional, but is recommended to ensure the fan properly overlaps the heatsink's air guide after reinstallation.
2. Remove the four heatsink screws (highlighted cyan below) in order, starting with #1, then #2, and continuing until #4.

![Heatsink screws](./img/heatsink-screws.webp)

3. Remove the heatsink from the system, being careful not to bend the heatsink pipes. It may take some pressure to break the seal of the thermal paste.
4. Using a paper towel, remove the existing thermal paste. You may also use a small amount of rubbing alcohol if the old paste is dried or difficult to remove.

![Thermal paste removal](./img/thermal-paste-removal.webp)

5. After cleaning the CPU and heatsink, apply a small line of thermal paste directly onto each die of the CPU chip.

![Thermal paste application](./img/thermal-paste-application.webp)

6. Carefully replace the heatsink.
7. Replace the four heatsink screws, starting with #1, then #2, and continuing until #4.
8. Replace the fans and bottom panel.

## Replacing the keyboard:

The keyboard can be replaced using the instructions below.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver  
**Time estimate:** 5 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy <span style="color:green;">●</span>  

### Steps to replace the keyboard:

1. Place the machine lid-side down.
    - Use a soft surface (such as a towel) to avoid scratches.
2. Remove the two keyboard screws, highlighted green below.

![Keyboard screws](./img/keyboard-screws.webp)
