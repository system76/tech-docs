# CPU Thermal Paste (Remove or Replace)

If you are experiencing thermal issues with your Thelio, one possible solution would be to change the Thermal paste. Thermal paste helps transfer heat from the CPU to the CPU Cooler via the heat sink.

Thermal paste can lose its effectiveness over time and may need to be removed and replaced from time to time.

This guide will explain how to remove the CPU Cooler, clean the CPU of thermal paste, and reapply a new coat.


## Remove the CPU Thermal Paste

Removing CPU thermal paste is straightforward but precise, involved, and requires removal of the CPU Cooler Shroud. It may also require removing the GPU for easier access.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver, Rubbing Alcohol, Paper Towels, Thermal Paste.

**Time estimate:** 15-20 mins.

**Difficulty:** ***Hard***

**Screws:** 12 total
  - 8 Thumbscrews (Phillips/Crosshead) on the Top Case.
  - 4 Thumbscrews (Phillips/Crosshead) on the CPU Cooler Shroud.
  - 4 Bracket Screws securing the CPU heat sink.

<!-- all of these screw numbers will need verified-->

1. Follow the steps in Removing the Top Case.
2. Follow the steps in Removing the CPU Cooler Shroud.
3. Follow the steps in Removing the GPU (if applicable).
4. Gently but firmly separate the Cooling Fan from the Heat Sink (fig. 33). The fan is held on by clips which can be pried from the sides of the heatsink.
5. Next, disconnect the power cables from the Cooling Fan.
6. Remove the four (4) bracket screws fastening the Heat Sink to the board. Loosen the screws one at a time and moving from opposite corner to opposite corner across the Heat Sink. For example: first, top left screw, then bottom right screw (fig. 34). This ensures even pressure between the brackets and the motherboard.
7. Lift the Heat Sink off of the motherboard.
8. You’ll notice that there is Thermal Paste coating the bottom of the Heat Sink as well as the CPU core.
9. Apply Rubbing Alcohol to a sheet of Paper Towel and wipe the Thermal Paste off of the bottom of the Heat Sink and CPU core until they are totally clean.
10. If you are replacing the Thermal Paste, continue on to the section Replacing the CPU Thermal Paste (See Important NOTE below).
11. Replace the Heat Sink over the CPU core.
12. Re-fasten the Heat Sink screws, again using the opposite corner method described above.
13. Follow the steps to Replace the GPU (if applicable).
14. Follow the steps to Replace the CPU Cooler Shroud.
15. Follow the steps to Replace the Top Case.

**NOTE: DO NOT use your Thelio without thermal paste.** Steps 11-12 above are there simply to help you reassemble your machine if you are not yet ready to apply new Thermal Paste. Running the machine without Thermal Paste could result in overheating, system shutdowns and possibly damage to the internal components.

## Replace the CPU Thermal paste

Removing CPU thermal paste is straightforward but precise, involved, and requires removal of the CPU Cooler Shroud. It may also require removing the GPU for easier access.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver, Thermal Paste.

**Time estimate:** 15-20 mins.

**Difficulty:** ***Hard***

**Screws:** 12 total
  - 8 Thumbscrews (Phillips/Crosshead) on the Top Case.
  - 4 Thumbscrews (Phillips/Crosshead) on the CPU Cooler Shroud.
  - 4 Bracket Screws securing the CPU heat sink.


1. Follow steps 1-9 in Removing the CPU Thermal Paste.
2. Once the Heat Sink and CPU core are free of old Thermal Paste, apply new paste in a line down the middle of the CPU core (fig. 37).
3. Once the paste is applied, replace the Heat Sink over top of it. The Heat Sink will spread the thermal paste across the CPU core, there is no need to spread it yourself.
4. Re-fasten the four (4) screws on the Heat Sink. In fastening the screws, partially tighten them one at a time, and move diagonally to the opposite corner. For example, tighten the top-left screw halfway, then move to the bottom right, and tighten that halfway, and so on. This ensures even pressure between the brackets and the motherboard.
5. Once the Heat Sink is fastened down, clip the CPU Cooling Fan back onto the Heat Sink.
6. Reconnect the power cables to the CPU Cooling Fan.
7. Follow the steps in Replacing the GPU (if applicable).
8. Next, follow the steps in Replacing the CPU Cooler Shroud.
9. Follow the steps in Replacing the Top Case.
10. Reconnect all external cables and peripherals, and turn the Power Supply switch to the “on” position.
11. Power on the Thelio to ensure successful boot.
