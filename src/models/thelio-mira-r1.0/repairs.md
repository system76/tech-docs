## Replacing a GPU:

Depending on which power supply is installed, Thelio Mira supports up to two 3-slot thick GPUs. There are three PCIe 4.0 x16 slots; however, the bottom slot only has room for a 1-slot thick card, and is only accessible if the second slot does not have a 3-slot thick card installed. The top two slots can accommodate cards as wide as 3-slots. An even thicker GPU can be installed in the top slot if only a single GPU is being used. Mixing NVIDIA and AMD GPUs is not recommended.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver  
**Time estimate:** 15 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy <span style="color:green;">●</span>  

### Steps to replace a GPU:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the top case](#removing-the-top-case).

![GPU brace removal](./img/gpu-brace-removal.jpg)
![GPU brace](./img/gpu-brace.jpg)

4. If you're removing a GPU, unplug the GPU power cable from the right side of the card. Hold down the latch on the connector while unplugging the cable.

![GPU power connections](./img/GPU-power-connectors.jpg)

5. Hold the latch on the motherboard to free the PCIe connection, then pull the card out of the slot.
    - If removing a GPU in the bottom slot, it may be necessary to remove the GPU in the top slot first in order to reach the bottom slot's latch.
    - If space is tight, a long object such as a screwdriver can be used to press the latch.

![PCIe slot latch](./img/pcie-latch.jpg)

6. After inserting the new GPU into its slot, connect the power cables.
    - If you are using only one GPU, it should go in the top PCIe slot.
    - If your Mira was originally equipped with fewer than 2 GPUs, power cables for two GPUs will still be preinstalled in your system. If they were not being used, they will be bundled up using velcro cable keepers to keep them out of the way.
7. Once all GPUs are installed, replace the GPU brace, back PCIe bracket, any PCI slot covers for empty slots, and finally the top case.
    - The GPU brace includes plastic pieces which are adjusted to the GPUs that originally shipped with the system. The brace is highly adjustable and should be able to accommodate many different GPU shapes and sizes. 

_The GPU brace's primary function is to prevent damage during shipping. The system can be run without the brace if it doesn't fit an upgraded card; the back PCIe bracket provides primary support for the GPUs._

## Replacing the M.2 drives:

Thelio Mira has two M.2 slots, which support PCIe NVMe Gen 4 x4, PCIe NVMe Gen 3 x4, or SATA III. Both slots support drive sizes 22110, 2280, 2260, and 2242.
