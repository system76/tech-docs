**Time estimate:** 12 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Medium <span style="color:orange;">●</span>  

### Steps to replace the WiFi/Bluetooth module:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the battery](#removing-the-battery), [remove the keyboard](#removing-the-keyboard), and [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Locate the wireless module. Remove any clear tape that is securing the wires.

![Wireless card](./img/wireless-card.jpg)

3. Gently remove the two antennas (highlighted red above) by pulling them up and away from the wireless card.
4. Remove the retaining screw opposite the M.2 slot, highlighted yellow above.
5. The wireless card will pop up at an angle. Remove the card from the M.2 slot.
6. Insert the new wireless card into the M.2 slot at an angle.
7. Replace the retaining screw.
8. Attach the two antennas by aligning the circular fittings and pressing onto the wireless card. The connectors will snap into place.
    - _Use caution when attaching the connectors; the pins can bend, break, or snap._

## Replacing the CMOS battery:

The CMOS battery supplies power to the system's CMOS chip. UEFI settings and the computer's hardware clock are stored on the CMOS. If your system doesn't boot, you can reset the CMOS to force a low-level hardware reset. If your clock is constantly resetting, it's likely your CMOS battery needs to be replaced.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver    
**Time estimate:** 15 minutes    
**Difficulty:** Medium <span style="color:orange;">●</span>

### Steps to replace the CMOS battery:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the keyboard](#removing-the-keyboard).

![CMOS battery](./img/cmos-battery.jpg)

2. Pick the CMOS battery up from the open side of the battery slot (on the right).
3. To clear the CMOS, [remove the main battery](#removing-the-battery), open the lid of the machine, and hold down the power button for at least 15 seconds to discharge any residual energy in the system.
4. Replace the CMOS battery, keyboard, and main battery.
5. Power up the machine. The system may power itself off and on after initial boot; this is normal behavior when the CMOS has been reset.

## Replacing the cooling system:

The Adder WS 2 has a single heatsink with two attached fans. The entire cooling assembly should be replaced together (fans cannot be removed individually.)

If a fan becomes noisy and cleaning it out doesn't fix the issue, you may need a new fan. [Contact Support](https://support.system76.com/) to start a warranty claim or parts purchase.

Depending on your climate and the age of the machine, it may be necessary to apply new thermal paste between the CPU/GPU and the heatsink. Thermal paste helps facilitate effective heat transfer between the CPU/GPU and the cooling equipment. These instructions can also be used in the unlikely event your heatsink needs replacing.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver, thermal paste  
**Time estimate:** 20 minutes  
**Difficulty:** High <span style="color:red;">●</span>  

### Steps to replace the fans/heatsink/thermal paste:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the battery](#removing-the-battery), [remove the keyboard](#removing-the-keyboard), and [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Unplug the two white fan connectors, highlighted red below.

![Thermal screws and connectors](./img/thermal-system.jpg)

3. Remove the six heatsink screws and four fan screws in order, starting with #1, then #2, and so on until #10.
    - The heatsink screws are spring-loaded, and will not detatch from the heatsink when unscrewed.
4. Remove the heatsink from the system, being careful not to bend the heatsink pipes. It may take some pressure to break the seal of the thermal paste.
5. Using a paper towel, remove the existing thermal paste. You may also use a small amount of rubbing alcohol if the old paste is dried or difficult to remove.

![Thermal paste removal](./img/thermal-paste-removal.webp)

6. After cleaning the CPU, GPU, and heatsink, apply a small line of thermal paste directly onto the CPU/GPU chips.

![Thermal paste application](./img/thermal-paste-application.jpg)

7. Carefully replace the heatsink.
8. Replace the six heatsink screws and four fan screws in order, starting with #1, then #2, and so on until #10.
9. Plug in the two white fan connectors.
