1. Line up the notch on the stick with the notch in the slot. One side of the RAM stick has fewer pins and is shorter. This will help you orient the stick.
2. Insert the RAM stick in the slot. The order of the slots matters, and there must be a RAM stick in the <!--is this slot the same in Major?--> left slot for the machine to boot.
3. Press evenly on the memory stick until both tabs lock into place. You’ll hear two clicks once it’s seated, and the clips will snap closed against the RAM.
4. Once the RAM is in place, replace the CPU Cooler Shroud (if applicable).
5. Replace the Top Case. <!--Hyperlink to Replacing the Top Case section needed here-->

7. Reconnect external power cable and turn power-supply switch to the on position.
8. Power the Thelio on to ensure the RAM is working correctly. If so, the computer will boot normally.
