4. Lift the bottom cover off, starting from the hinges in the back (it's easiest to pull from just above the battery slot.)

## Replacing the RAM:

RAM acts as temporary storage for your computer. More RAM generally provides better performance. If you've purchased new RAM, need to replace your RAM, or are reseating your RAM, follow these steps.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver  
**Time estimate:** 10 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy <span style="color:green;">●</span>  

### Steps to replace the RAM:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Press the small tabs on both sides of the RAM simultaneously. The RAM should spring up to an angle.

3. Remove the RAM from the slot.
4. Insert the new RAM (or reseat the existing RAM) by placing it in the keyed slot and pressing down on the RAM until it clicks into place.

## Replacing an M.2/NVMe SSD:

This model supports up to two M.2 SSDs. Both M.2 slots are size 2280. The top slot (shown with the yellow box in the image below) supports either SATA III or PCIe NVMe Generation 3, and the bottom slot (orange box) supports only PCIe NVMe Generation 3.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver

![2.5" drive side screw](./img/25-side-screw.jpg)

5. Insert the new 2.5" drive into the drive bracket and replace the two side screws.
6. Plug the 2.5" drive into the SATA port and set the drive into the case.
7. Screw the drive bracket back into the case.

## Replacing the cooling system:

If one of the fans becomes noisy and cleaning it out doesn't fix the issue, you may need a new fan. Contact Support to start a warranty claim or parts purchase.

Depending on your climate and the age of the machine, it may be necessary to apply new thermal paste between the CPU/GPU and the heatsink. Thermal paste helps facilitate effective heat transfer between the CPU/GPU and the cooling equipment. These instructions can also be used in the unlikely event your heatsink needs replacing.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver  
**Time estimate:** 20 minutes  
**Difficulty:** High <span style="color:red;">●</span>  

### Steps to replace the fans/heatsink/thermal paste:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Locate the CPU heatsink screws.
3. Remove the screws, starting with #1, then #2, and continuing until you have removed #11.

![Thermal screws](./img/thermal-screws.jpg)

4. Carefully remove the heatsink/fans from the case.
5. Using a paper towel, remove the existing thermal paste. You may also use a small amount of rubbing alcohol to remove excess or difficult-to-remove paste.

![Heatsink](./img/heatsink-removed.jpg)

6. After cleaning the CPU, GPU, and heatsink, apply a small line of thermal paste directly onto the CPU and GPU core.

![Thermal paste](./img/thermal-paste.jpg)

7. Carefully replace the heatsink.
8. Replace the screws, starting with #1, then #2, and so on until #11. Do not fully tighten until all of the screws have been started, then fully tighten all screws.

## Replacing the CMOS battery:

The CMOS battery supplies power to the Gazelle's CMOS chip. Changes you make to the UEFI firmware settings and the computer's hardware clock are stored on the CMOS. If your Gazelle doesn't boot, you can reset the CMOS to force a low-level hardware reset. If your clock is constantly resetting, it's likely your CMOS battery needs replacing.

**Warning (ingestion hazard):** Keep batteries out of reach of children. Death or serious injury can occur if ingested. If a battery is suspected to be swallowed or inserted inside any part of the body, seek immediate medical attention. In the US, you can also call the National Battery Ingestion Hotline for guidance: [1 (800) 498-8666](tel:18004988666)

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver  
**Time estimate:** 10 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Medium <span style="color:orange;">●</span>  

### Steps to replace the CMOS battery:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Locate the CMOS battery, which is connected to the motherboard via a red and black wire, between the 2.5" drive bay and the edge of the computer.

![CMOS battery](./img/cmos-battery.jpg)

3. Unplug the small white connector that connects the CMOS battery to the motherboard. If you are replacing the battery, use a thin plastic tool to pry the battery up from where it's stuck to the case.
4. Power up the Gazelle. The system may power itself off and on after initial boot; this is normal behavior when the CMOS has been reset.
5. Press Enter at the CMOS/UEFI reset message prompts.
6. If the system boots into the BIOS/UEFI setup utility, press F4 to load defaults, then F10 to save and resume normal boot.

## Replacing the external battery:

The battery provides primary power whenever the system is unplugged.

The model number for the Gazelle 15's battery is `NH50BAT-4`; the original part number may be `6-87-NH50S-41C01` or `6-87-NH50S-42D01`, depending on the production date of the machine. Third-party battery sellers may list one or both of these numbers, and may offer other compatible part numbers with the same model number. You can also [contact System76](https://support.system76.com) to purchase a replacement battery.

**Tools required:** None  
**Time estimate:** 1 minute  
**Difficulty:** Easy <span style="color:green;">●</span>  

### Steps to replace the external battery:

1. Place the machine lid-side down.
    - Use a soft surface (such as a towel) to avoid scratches.
2. Slide the locks that hold the battery to their unlocked positions. (One lock will click into place, while the other is on a spring.)
3. Hold back the spring-loaded lock while removing the battery.
4. Replace the battery/insert the new battery, then slide the clicking lock to its locked position.

## Replacing the wireless card:

Your Gazelle's WiFi and Bluetooth are both handled by the same module. It is a standard M.2 2230 slot with PCIe and USB interfaces (E-key).

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver  
**Time estimate:** 10 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Medium <span style="color:orange;">●</span>  

### Steps to replace the WiFi/Bluetooth module:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Locate the wireless module.

![Wireless card](./img/wireless-card.jpg)

3. Gently remove the two antennas by pulling them up and away from the wireless card.
4. Remove the retaining screw opposite the M.2 slot.
5. Remove the wireless card from the M.2 slot.
6. Insert the new wireless card into the M.2 slot.
7. Replace the retaining screw.
8. Attach the two antennas by aligning the circular fitting and pressing onto the wireless card. The connector will snap into place. _Use caution when attaching the connectors; the pins can bend, break, or snap._
