4. Reconnect the CMOS battery, [reconnect the main battery](#replacing-the-battery), and [replace the M.2 SSD](#replacing-an-m2nvme-ssd).
5. Replace the bottom panel and power up the Oryx Pro. The system may power itself off and on after initial boot; this is normal behavior when the CMOS has been reset.

## Replacing the cooling system:

If the CPU/GPU fans become noisy and cleaning them out doesn't fix the issue, you may need a new fan.

The Oryx Pro 10 comes with heat-conductive metal on the dedicated GPU, and uses regular thermal paste for the CPU. These materials help facilitate effective heat transfer between the CPU/GPU and the cooling equipment.

- Thermal paste should generally be replaced after removing the heatsink; thermal paste also dries over time, so depending on your climate and the age of the machine, applying new thermal paste may increase thermal performance.
- The heat-conductive metal does not dry out, and replacing it is optional; replacement may be useful if the previous metal has flowed out of the proper area for cooling.

Replacement heat-conductive metal fitted to the machine and replacement fans can be obtained by [contacting support](https://support.system76.com).

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver  
**Time estimate:** 40 minutes  
**Difficulty:** High <span style="color:red;">●</span>  

### Steps to replace the fans/heatsink/thermal paste:

1. Power off the machine. Wait 20 minutes for the machine to cool down to room temperature.
    - **Warning:** Removing the heatsink before the machine has cooled to room temperature may result in heat-conductive metal flowing onto the motherboard and causing irrepairable damage.
2. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
3. Unscrew the fan and heatsink screws in the order of the stamped numbers, starting with #1, then #2, and continuing until you have removed #12.
    - The screws are held captive and will not come out of the fans/heatsink. The fan screws will click when they are fully loosened.
    - The order for the 17" model is shown below; the screws are numbered differently on the 15" model. Follow the order stamped into the heatsink metal.
    - Do not remove the smaller screws holding the fan covers onto the fans.

![Thermal screws](./img/thermal-screws.webp)

4. If there is any clear tape securing the heatsink/fans or the fan wires, remove it.
5. Unplug the two white fan connectors from the motherboard (highlighted red above).
6. Remove the heatsink/fans from the case, being careful not to bend the heatsink pipes. It may take some pressure to break the seal of the thermal paste.
7. Using a paper towel, remove the existing thermal paste from the CPU, the CPU heatsink, the border of the GPU die, and the GPU heatsink.
    - A small amount of rubbing alcohol can be used if the old paste is dried or difficult to remove.
    - The heat-conductive metal may have some holes where pieces stuck to the die or heatsink.
    - If you are not replacing the heat-conductive metal, do not pick or wipe the heat-conductive metal off of the GPU heatsink.

![Thermal paste removal](./img/thermal-paste-removal.webp)

8. If you are replacing the heat-conductive metal, remove the plastic cover from the GPU heatsink.
    - A fingernail or a thin plastic tool can be used to pick a side of the plastic cover up from the GPU heatsink.
    - **Warning:** The heat-conductive metal is electrically conductive. Be careful not to get specks of heat-conductive metal onto the motherboard. The heat-conductive metal can cause the motherboard to malfunction or fail if it makes contact.
    - After removing the plastic covers, wipe away any remaining heat-conductive metal residue from the heatsink and GPU.
    - Some adhesive residue may remain on the GPU heatsink.

![Heat-conductive metal removal](./img/heat-conductive-metal-removal.webp)

9. Apply the new heat-conductive metal to the GPU heatsink, matching the orientation of the plastic covering with the diagonal corner of its respective surface.
    - **Warning:** Replacement heat-conductive metal obtained from System76 will include the plastic covering. If you are applying third-party heat-conductive or liquid metal, clean and reuse the plastic covering from the stock heat-conductive metal to prevent the aftermarket metal from flowing onto the motherboard when heated.

![Heat-conductive metal application](./img/heat-conductive-metal-application.webp)

10. Apply a small line of thermal paste directly onto each CPU die.
11. Apply a line of thermal paste around the border of the GPU die.
    - The purpose of this border is to further prevent melted heat-conductive metal from flowing onto the motherboard during operation.
    - Keep the nozzle of the thermal paste tube pressed against the surface of the chip; dispense the thermal paste slowly while moving the nozzle.
    - Be careful not to apply too much thermal paste around the GPU. Only a thin layer is needed.

![Thermal paste application](./img/thermal-paste-application.webp)

12. Carefully replace the heatsink.
13. Tighten the fan and heatsink screws, starting with #1, then #2, and so on until #12.
14. Plug the two white fan connectors back into the motherboard.

## Replacing the speakers:

The system has two bottom-firing speakers, which can be removed and replaced individually.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver  
**Time estimate:** 10 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy <span style="color:green;">●</span>

### Steps to replace the speakers:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover). For the right speaker, also [remove the outermost SSD](#replacing-an-m2nvme-ssd).
2. Disconnect the speaker wire from the motherboard.
    - This can alternatively be done after freeing the speaker.

![Speaker screws and connectors](./img/speakers.webp)

3. Unscrew the speaker screws and lift the speaker out of the machine.
    - The right speaker has three screws; the left speaker has two screws.
    - The speaker wire may be partially routed behind other components or tape; be careful when removing it.
4. Place the new speaker in the machine, plug in the connector, replace the screws, and reinstall the outermost SSD (if necessary) and bottom panel.

## Replacing the keyboard:

The keyboard can be replaced if its switches or electronics have been damaged.

**Warning:** The Oryx Pro 10's keyboard is held in by a strip of adhesive in addition to one of the bottom panel screws and the perimeter clips. The adhesive may be difficult to remove from the keyboard and/or case, and while the keyboard should still be functional if removed carefully, it is likely that permanent aesthetic damage will occur to the bottom side of the keyboard during removal. Removal is not recommended unless the keyboard is malfunctioning.

**Tools required:** Cross-head (Phillips) screwdriver, tweezers, spudger tool (optional)  
**Time estimate:** 20 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Hard <span style="color:red;">●</span>

### Steps to replace the keyboard:

1. Follow the steps above to [remove the bottom cover](#removing-the-bottom-cover).
2. Locate the keyboard adhesive strip access point near the right fan.
